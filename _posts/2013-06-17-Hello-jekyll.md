This is my first post on this site, my new blog. The last one, well... was kinda abbandoned but that's history.

Hey, this is my first post on this site, my new blog. The last one, well… was kind of abandoned but that’s history.
Now I’m writing on my brand new shining [jekyll][jekyll] powered static blog, and it’s hosted on [Github][github] so that makes it double special. Yay!!

The (worth to mention) stack for this site would be:

* [Jekyll Boostrap][jekyllboostrap] as bloging framework
* [Jekyll][jekyll] as a parsing engine
* [Ruby][ruby] providing the scripting layer
* [Github Pages][github] as hosting

## What do I expect of this blog?

I think mainly to have a space to share creations and interesting resources.

## Is this a personal Blog?

Yes, only in a possessive way but I suppose that the main topics will go around development, web development mostly, and also about electronics and robotics.

## Any final words?

Of course, a little disclaimer, as English is not my mother tongue, typos and grammar glitches are expected so be warned :)
